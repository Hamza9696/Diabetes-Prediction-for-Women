This web app predicts the real time glucose level of women and also the level of diabetes. It by takes  inputs such as pregnancies,blood pressure, age, bmi, insulin level and suggests diabetic users to take appropriate diet to maintain their sugar level. It predicts the glucose level using machine learning algorithm of multivariate regression.The classifier has been trained using the diabetes dataset of women older than 21 years. It is developed using Python, scikitlearn, Flask, HTML, matplotlib. Datasets used in this project are Diabetes dataset and food items dataset.
